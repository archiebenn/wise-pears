## Goal of this project  

- My PhD will involve the use of microCT scanning ant nests to gain a 3D image of their architecture  
- I want to quantify the visibility of different areas within the nests from these scans to investigate the impact of different digging conditions on the 'openness' of ant nests  
- However, I also want to develop a more general tool which can be used by others, be it in ecology or other areas using microCT  
- So this project aims to be as open as possible, utilising `.npy` objects to generate visibility graphs via `networkx` and 3D visualisation of visibility using `pyvista`   

## Tool pipeline goal (as of october 2026)  

- Aim of the tool is as follows:  

```
1. Raw microCT scans converted to volumes  
2. Volumes thresholded to binary (0 = solid/soil, 1 = open/excavated)  
3. Convert these volumes to `.npy` data type  
4. Load into python and tun `wise_pears` on the `.npy`  
5. `wise_pears` will run an occlusion-based pairwise ray-tracing algorithm between open voxels  
6. If a pair is occluded by a closed voxel, pair-wise 'is_visible' == 0 
7. If not occluded, pair-wise 'is_visible' == 1    
8. This algorithm will run using a C++ algorithm, accessed by python via `pybind11`  
9. Output of C++ function will return a visibility score between 0-1 for every open voxel in the volume  
10. From these scores, a visibility visualiser can be formed (coloured by visibility) using `pyvista`  
11. Also, a visibility graph from `networkx` can be formed too  
12. Tool will return both of these as the output for further analysis  
```

## Main issues  

- scaling issue: as this is currently set to be pairwise, comparisons between voxels will scale as O(n_open_voxels^2)  
- for large scans of nests at high resolution, this will massively increase compute expense   
- therefore need to implement in a tight loop in C++ and optimise using known solutions (to-do)  
- already going to use the Amanitides & Woo algorithm, but could think of some pair-wise solutions too  

### 26-10-2026  

- started development of `wise-pears`
- set up python project development and learned about how to create these pip-installable tools
- tested out using `pyvista` with some generated simple 3D binary volumes with 'solid voxel == 0' and 'open voxel == 1'  

### 28-10-26  

- generated `intricate_volumes.py` which uses `random` module and a set of defined rules to excavate out random volumes from a set full volume size
- the idea is to generate some intricate test volumes which are similar to ant nests for the development of the visibility graph  
- e.g here is an excavated volume, visualised in `pyvista`, from:
  ```
  c = tunnel_excavater(size=200, seed=3, n_steps=200000, branch_prob=0.0001, radius=1)
  ```

- got the is_visible function for a single pair visibility using Amanatides & Woo algorithm in `woo_test.cpp` working  
- then developed the main visible_pairs function which loops over every set of open voxel pairs (in one direction only) and tests with is_visible, returning a Nx3 array of open voxel coords and a Mx2 array of visible pair indices for that Nx3 array  
- this will allow both the visualisation with `pyvista` and the development ot `networkx` visibility graphs to be worked on, as the coordinates of each voxel and the visibility to each other open voxel from that one is saved  
- started on a test run for colouring `pyvista` outputs by a visibility score. here is an example on a 100^3 volume:

- also did some benchmarking timings and got upt to around 70s for the 100^3 volume  
- the current C++ script can definitely be optimised further, e.g multithreading  

### 29-10-26  

- got claude to translate my C++ script line for line into Python, just to test benchmarking  
- (this is for the visible pairs calculation)  
- here is an example of the speed-up from implementing in C++ on a 45^3 volume:  

```
open voxels: 7416  edges: 125340
C++:    0.22159s
Python: 18.12656s  (82x slower)
```

- so can see how much extra time this would add for large volumes, and this is still single thread on C++  
- went over some pytests with Claude too as good to have for development  
- realised my C++ algorithm treats a ray passing exactly through a diagonal where one corner is solid treats the ray line as visible, which is not that strict -> could leave it as-is as not a very large issue but need to explicitly mention corner-grazing behaviour  
- want to look into other ways of reducing computation - need to add multithreading on outer loop and should speed up  
- added multithreading with help from Claude  
- 10.5x speed up on 100^3 macbook which is great, but then tried to do 150^3 and had memory errors  
- need to decide whether i want to fix that and allow bigger volumes or just have a hard limit on open voxel counts in volume
